				Need support? Justice for Muslims Coalition’s Rapid Response Network is here for you!
			</div>
			<div class = "para">
We are a group of non-Muslim allies organizing to support communities under attack, with an emphasis on providing for Muslim community needs. Building a strong community means caring for each other!
This network consists of dedicated, trusted, and trained volunteers working under the Muslim leadership of the DC Justice for Muslims Coalition. We are not lawyers, but we can help connect you with legal support if necessary. This is not a professional service, and we will connect you with others if we’re unable to provide what you need. Reach out to us and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.
How can we support you? Please provide as many details as you feel comfortable sharing.
We are organizing volunteer groups to provide for specific needs. With which of these groups would you like to be connected? [Note: As many of our groups are not yet running, we might simply connect you with an existing resource for the time being to fill certain needs.]
